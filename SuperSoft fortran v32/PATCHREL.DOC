	PATCHREL DOCUMENTATION

  PATCHREL IS A UTILITY PROGRAM THAT OPERATES ON REL FILES
  AND HAS TWO PURPOSES:

	A.	TO COMPRESS LIBRARYS THAT WERE FORMED BY
		PIP'ING OR COPY'ING REL FILES TOGETHER INTO
		A LIBRARY. (UNWANTED NULLS ARE ELIMINATED.)
	B.	TO UPDATE A LIBRARY BY REPLACING SELECTED
		MODULES.

  TO EXECUTE:

	A>PATCHREL

	(NOTE,  NO FILES SPECIFIED IN COMMAND STRING.)

  PATCHREL WILL ASK FOR THREE FILES:

	INPUT FILE, OUTPUT FILE, PATCH FILE

  EACH FILE MUST BE SPECIFIED BY FILE.EXT, NO DEFAULT
  EXTENSION IS ASSUMED.

  BASICALLY, PATCHREL READS THE INPUT FILE AND OUTPUTS IT
  IN COMPRESSED FORM TO THE OUTPUT FILE.  IF THE PATCH FILE
  IS NOT EMPTY, ANY MODULES IN THE INPUT FILE THAT MATCH
  FILES IN THE PATCH FILE ARE REPLACED BY THE PATCH VERSION.

  TO COMPRESS A LIBRARY FILE WITH NO RELACEMENT, YOU MUST
  CONSTRUCT A NULL PATCH FILE AND SPECIFY IT AS THE PATCH
  FILE. (THIS CAN BE DONE WITH THE EDITOR: OPEN A FILE,
  AND EXIT WITHOUT INSERTING).

  TO PATCH A LIBRARY YOU NEED A PATCH FILE.  UPDATES TO
  S.S.S. FORTRAN IV WILL IN MOST CASES COME AS PATCHES, SO
  PLEASE SAVE THIS FILE.
