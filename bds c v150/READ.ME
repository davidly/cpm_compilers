		   Description of Package Components
		--------------------------------------


Note:   CC.COM announces version number  "v1.50a" to show
	that this version has had some bugs fixed since the
	previous v1.50 release. ONLY CC.COM announces "1.50a",
	though;  all other  components of the package are still
	simply designated "1.50".

BDS C v1.50 is supplied by the author on two eight-inch single-density IBM
disks. One disk contains the essential files of the package, and the other
contains auxiliary files and the CDB debugger package. This 2-disk breakdown
applies only to the standard 8" disk format, though; if you obtained the
package on another format, the files might be differently arranged among the
supplied diskettes.

Every standard distribution package should contain a User's Guide, complete
with registration forms and BDS C User's Group application form, and either
two 8" diskettes or however diskettes it takes in your format to hold the
(approximately) 480K worth of data in the BDS C package.

Files with an asterisk (*) after their names should be placed in the
"Default library directory" on your CP/M system. The default directory is
explained in chapter 1 of the BDS C User's Guide under "Configuration".

Files with a plus (+) after their names should be placed in the currently
logged directory when using the compiler, or else in your standard command file
area if you are running an alternative CCP (such as "ZCPR" or MicroShell) that
knows about path searching.

-----------------

The Kernighan & Ritchie textbook, "The C Programming Language", should be
available to all BDS C users as a reference and good tutorial on the C
language. For most of the first three years of BDS C's distribution, when
Lifeboat was the exclusive distributor, the textbook was distributed with
every copy of the compiler. Nowadays the book is more readily available, and
many users who order BDS C may already own a copy and not want to pay for
another one. Therefore some distributors may choose not to include the
textbook in the standard package; nevertheless, all BDS C users should make
sure to get a copy of the book somehow.
