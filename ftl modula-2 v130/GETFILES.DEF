DEFINITION MODULE GetFiles;

(*	Pattern is a pattern to use for the search
	names returns a list of matching file name (with no device name
		on the front)
	count returns number of names returned in names

	If the given name contains no wild card, it is always returned
	as the only match, whether it exists or not 

	While this means that this routine cannot be used to check for
	the existence of a file, it can be used to convert a parameter
	to a filename as required by the module Files *)
