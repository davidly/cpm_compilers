DEFINITION MODULE SetUpCall;

(*	SET Up call parameters for a program and chain to it

	This module is used by the editor for calling the
	compilers.

	The second parameter is the fcb for the file which is to be compiled

	It will be set up on the command line as a parameter. It will be followed
	by /E as an option.

	If this is too clever for your requirements, you could use the module
	'Chain' directly.
