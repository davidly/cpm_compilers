DEFINITION MODULE ScreenDummy;

(*	this module was written to enable
	several modules to be compiled
	on machines with tight TPA's. The same
	thing can be done with other modules if
	your TPA is tighter than that of my test
	machine.

	What has been done is to replace a large
	symbol table (that of ScreenIO) with a 
	small symbol table (this module). This
	reduces the symbol table space used by the
	calling modules. This is further discussed
	in the manual.
