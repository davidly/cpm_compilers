It implements the full 8080  instruction set as well as structured conditionals.  To create  an Assembler language definition, use the defining word CODE.   It may, but does not have to be, terminated with C;.  How the   assembler operates is a very interesting example of the power   of CREATE DOES>  Basically, the instructions are categoriezed   and a defining word is created for each category.  When the     mnemonic for the instruction is interpreted, it compiles        itself.                                                                                                                                                                                         \ 8080 Assembler Defining Words & Registers           11Apr84map: LABEL   CREATE   ASSEMBLER   ;                                205 CONSTANT DOES-OP                                            3 CONSTANT DOES-SIZE                                            : DOES?

To invoke the            debugger, type DEBUG XXX where XXX is the name of the           word you wish to trace.  When XXX executes, you will get        a single step trace showing you the word within XXX that        is about to execute, and the contents of the parameter          stack.  If you wish to poke around, type F and you can          interpret Forth commands until you type RESUME, and execution   of XXX will continue where it left off.  This debugger works    by patching the NEXT routine, so it is highly machine and       implementation dependent.  The same idea should work            however on any Forth system with a centralized NEXT routine.    \ 16 Bit Subtract Subroutine                          04Apr84mapVOCABULARY BUG   ALSO BUG ALSO DEFINITIONS                      VARIABLE <IP   VARIABLE IP>                                     VARIABLE CNT   VARIABLE 'DEBUG                                                                                                  ASSEMBLER LABEL SSUB      ( HL = HL - DE )                         L A MOV   E SUB   A L MOV    ( LOW BYTE )                       H A MOV   D SBB   A H MOV    ( HI BYTE )                        RET                                                          LABEL   ?RANGE          ( COMPARE DE WITH LOW & HI )                                    ( RETURNS CS IF IN RANGE   )               <IP LHLD SSUB CALL RNC   IP> LHLD SSUB CALL    CMC RET                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \ Subroutine to Patch NEXT                            26MAY83HHLASSEMBLER HEX                                                   LABEL FNEXT                                                        0A A MVI   >NEXT    STA       ( B LDAX )                        03 A MVI   >NEXT 1+ STA       ( B INX  )                        6F A MVI   >NEXT 2+ STA       ( A L MOV )                       RET                                                          LABEL   DNEXT                                                      B LDAX   B INX   A L MOV   B LDAX   B INX   A H MOV          HERE                                                               M E MOV  H INX   M D MOV   XCHG     PCHL                     CONSTANT DNEXT1                                                 DECIMAL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \ Debug version of Next                               04Apr84mapASSEMBLER                                                       LABEL   DEBNEXT                                                    B D MOV   C E MOV                                               ?RANGE CALL  CS IF                                                 CNT LDA A INR CNT STA                                           2 CPI 0= IF                                                        A XRA CNT STA                                                   FNEXT CALL                                                      B PUSH                                                          'DEBUG LHLD                                                     DNEXT1 JMP                                                   THEN                                                         THEN                                                            DNEXT JMP                                                                                                                    \ Patch and Fix NEXT                                  13Apr84mapHEX                                                             CODE PNEXT                                                         C3 A MVI   >NEXT STA                                            DEBNEXT H LXI   >NEXT 1+ SHLD                                   >NEXT JMP C;

NEXT is a macro which assembles a jump to >NEXT.                There are a few special case instructions not handled in the    1MI thru 5MI schema.                                            The structured conditionals make it easier to write correct and   understandable code, and reduce the need for forward reference  and meaningless labels with silly names.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \ 16 Bit Subtract Subroutine                          04Apr84mapBUG   The vocabulary that holds the Debugging Words             <IP  IP>   The range of IP values we are interested in          CNT is a pass counter.
