F83V2-80.ARK contains F83.COM, a public domain implementation of 
FORTH-83 version 2.0 for CP/M-80 that is ready to run.  It also 
contains source files.  

These files are identical to those distributed in F83V2-80.LBR.  They 
have now been put into this ARK to take advantage of the more efficient 
file compression methods available.

The original Laxen-Perry distribution had these files squeezed with a 
program that took hours (!) to run to unsqueeze. 

The VIEW word expects certain source blocks to be on drive A: and 
certain source files to be on drive B:.  If you have a hard disk 
system, you can  follow the directions in README.80 to recompile your 
system with all of the source blocks on your hard disk and the VIEW 
file numbers will be set up correctly. 

Here are the files in this ARK:

--> FILE:  F83     .COM         The FORTH system compiled.
--> FILE:  README  .1ST         This file
--> FILE:  README  .80          Original F83 instructions
--> FILE:  F83-FIXS.TXT         Changes from F83 v.1.0
                         These "blocks" are the F83 sources
--> FILE:  KERNEL80.BLK         Kernel source
--> FILE:  META80  .BLK         Metacompiler source
--> FILE:  CPU8080 .BLK         8080 dependent code   
--> FILE:  EXTEND80.BLK         Extensions source
--> FILE:  UTILITY .BLK         The UTILITY source 
                         These blocks are applications
--> FILE:  HUFFMAN .BLK         A VERY slow compression program
