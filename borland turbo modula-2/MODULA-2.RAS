Modula-2  is  a  modern programming language  created  by  Niklaus  Wirth.  
Similar to Pascal in many ways, anyone presently familiar with Pascal  can 
easily  use Modula-2.  Modula-2 is a structured language,  lending  itself 
well  to  the  techniques of structured programming, so it  makes  a  good 
"teaching"   language  for  beginners  who  wish  to   learn   programming 
fundamentals.  Modula-2 is a compiled language, so programs written in  it 
execute many times faster than a comparable interpreted BASIC program.

Z80  Turbo Modula-2 was created by Borland International, the creators  of 
Turbo  Pascal.   It  is an in-depth  and  professional  implementation  of 
Modula-2  for Z80-compatible computers running a CP/M-80  compatible  disk 
operating  system.  This includes Kaypro, Commodore 128, Morrow,  Osborne, 
Amstrad,  and many other computers.  The Z80 Turbo Modula-2 package  comes 
complete  with  500+  page manual; WordStar-like  programming  editor  for 
creating  and  modifying program source code or any text  file,  compiler, 
extensive  function  library  (modules),  and  installation  program   and 
terminal descriptor database.  Everything needed to begin creating  useful 
programs in Modula-2 has been included.

Z80 Turbo Modula-2 supports the following features:

     o Instant invocation of editor when the compiler detects  programming 
errors.   You  can quickly correct the mistake, and the  compiler  resumes 
where it left off.

     o Very fast compilation utilizing a one-pass method.

     o Extensive  function  library - 14 modules  incorporating  over  100 
procedures.   Standard  Modula-2 modules such as InOut are  available,  in 
addition  to  single  (6 digits) and double precision  (14  digits)  math, 
command  line access and manipulation, input/output redirection, and  much 
more.  You may also add your own extensions or replace existing modules as 
you see fit.

     o Programs  can  be  organized with overlays; permits  code  size  to 
exceed available memory.

     o Can  generate Z80 native code using an optional second pass of  the 
compiler.

     o Bit manipulation and sets.

     o Easy inclusion of assembly-language routines in binary form, or  in 
relocatable (REL) form.  Turbo Modula-2 can even search REL libraries  and 
include only the routines of interest.

     o Extensions  to  Modula-2 include comfortable generalized  READ  and 
WRITE  statements (like Turbo Pascal), string comparison  and  assignment, 
multidimensional  open  arrays,  and exception  handling  to  control  the 
program in case of errors.

     o The  compiler can optionally flag nonstandard statements to  ensure 
portability  to other Modula-2 environments.  Programs written with  Turbo 
Modula-2 can be portable to any other computing environment.


Turbo Modula-2 compared to Turbo Pascal:

     o Turbo Modula-2 has separate compilation.  This means that  whenever 
a  change  is made in a supporting or dependent module, only  the  changed 
module  must  be  recompiled.   This  is  especially  important  on  large 
projects,  where  under Turbo Pascal, even the  smallest  change  required 
recompilation  of  the entire project.  Unlike some other  languages  that 
allow separate compilation, Modula-2 still performs full type and  version 
checking between modules.

     o The  library  facilities  of  Turbo  Modula-2  allow  a  full   and 
extensible set of primitives, which are not included in the final  program 
unless  specifically requested by the programmer.  Thus, programs  can  be 
optimized for size even though hundreds of library functions may exist.

     o Turbo  Modula-2 includes support for  coroutines  (multiprocessing) 
and interrupt handlers.

     o Existing  Turbo  Pascal programs can be easily converted  to  Turbo 
Modula-2.

     o Turbo   Modula-2  possesses  additional  numeric  types:   unsigned 
integers  (CARDINAL), long integers (LONGIant  on  large 
projects,  where  under Turbo Pascal, even the  smallest  change  required 
recompilation  of  the entire project.  Unlike some other  languages  that 
allow separate compilation, Modula-2 still performs full type and  version 
checking between modules.

These allow greater precision and flexibility in mathematical calculations
