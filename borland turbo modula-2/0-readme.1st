
Turbo-Modula-2

This is the Modula-2 Compiler of Borland.
I set up the Terminal for Linux with 25 lines and 80 columns.

A xterm under X Windows starts with 24 lines. You have to expand it to
25 lines or use the "-geometry" - option (see man xterm(1) respectively X(7)).
Under the xterm and the console of Linux you can use the cursor movement key
like char left, char right, line up, line down. You can still use all Wordstar
cursor movement Control-keys, delete/insert and the block functions.

I don't know if the console of FreeBSD uses the same strings which are
generate by the cursor movement keys.

I add modules with them you can calculate with dates. See DAYS.DEF/DAYS.MOD
(or TAGE.DEF/TAGE.MOD for the german people) and BIRTHDAY.COM/BIRTHDAY.MOD.

There are also CRC32 routines (CRC32*.Z80) and the definition files
(CRC32*.DEF) to use it under the Modula-Compiler (see CRC3.MOD and CRCX.MOD).

Many of the Modules are in AGL.LIB which will be searched after SYSLIB.LIB
(see Options in M2.COM and then the Path option).

Have a lot of fun.
