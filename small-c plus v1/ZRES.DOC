NAME
	zres - resolve library references
 
SYNOPSIS
	zres  d: library objfile1 [objfile2 ...]
 
DESCRIPTION 

ZRES resolves library references for a given object file or
list of object files.  To do this it must be provided with a
library file and index, as created by the ZLIB utility.

At the end of its processing ZRES generates a submit file which
will invoke the linker to construct an executable file with the
same name as the first "OBJ" file, but with the extension "COM".
The submit file also contains commands to: load a plot RSX (if
necessary), return control to drive "d:" and move the "COM" file
to that drive.  It also deletes temporary files.

It is intended that ZRES should be used in the CC.SUB script,
which moves from the current drive to the memory drive before
carrying out the compilation.  
 
EXAMPLE
 
ZRES will resolve references for the file TEST.C on this disk as
follows:

	M>zres a: clib test
