TRACE
 
If the trace option of the compiler is used, each call to err()
results in a walkback trace of function calls.  (Err() is in the
IOLIB library. For details, see IOLIB.DOC.)
 
A header and two calls are added to the code generated for each
function. The function header contains a string with the function
name.
 
	;trials() 
	CC4:	DB 'trials',0	;the function name 
	QTRIALS: 
		LD HL,CC4	;save pointer to function 
		PUSH HL		;header block. 
		CALL CCREGIS	;register function entry. 
				;ccregis() pushes onto the stack
				;a pointer to the function that
				;called this one, and saves in
				;CURRENT a pointer to this one. 
	;{	z=a(x); 
		LD HL,QX 
 
		...		;regular code. 
 
	;} 
		CALL CCLEAVI	;register function return 
				;(resets CURRENT to point to 
				;the function that called this 
				;one) 
		POP BC		;discard the pointer added by 
				;ccregis(). 
		POP BC		;discard the pointer to the 
				;header block of this function.

 
		RET 
 
Note that this method permits a walkback trace even in the 
presence of recursive function calls.
