		MATH Library User's Documentation
 
MATH supplies certain mathematical functions. They give
at least 11 significant digits in all known cases.
  
 
FUNCTIONS
 
sqrt(x);		square root 
exp(x);			exponential 
log(x);			natural logarithm 
log10(x);		log base 10 
pow(x,y);		pow(x,y) = x**y
 
atan(x);		arc tangent 
				(value in range -pi/2 to pi/2) 
atan2(x,y);		arc tangent of x/y 
				(value in range -pi to pi) 
cos(x);			cosine 
sin(x);			sine 
tan(x);			tangent 
 
cosh(x);		hyperbolic cosine
sinh(x);		hyperbolic sine
tanh(x);		hyperbolic tangent
 
In each case, the arguments and the value returned are doubles.
 
 
INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION
 
The square root is calculated by the Newton-Raphson method. The
hyperbolic functions are calculated in terms of the exponential.
The other functions are calculated by means of power series
after range reduction.
