SYNOPSIS
	wildcard(spec)
	char *spec;

DESCRIPTION
	The function wildcard() returns a pointer to an array of
	pointers to character strings.  In full C that would be
	written:

	    char **wildcard(spec)
	    char *spec;

	In Small-C/Plus the best we can do is return an integer.
	The character strings contain file names from the current
	disk which match a wildcard specification at 'spec'.  Up
	to 63 pointers are available, with the last valid one
	being followed by NULL pointer.  If no files match the
	specification wildcard() returns a NULL pointer.

NOTE
	The file specification must be twelve characters long in
	the format "FFFFFFFF.EEE".  Names should be padded at
	the right with spaces to fit this format.  A wild
	character is denoted by a question mark.
