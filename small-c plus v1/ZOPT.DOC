NAME
	zopt - assembly code optimiser
 
SYNOPSIS
	zopt  [-c] asmfile
 
DESCRIPTION 

ZOPT is an optimiser for the assembler output of the
Small-C/Plus compiler.  "asmfile" is a file containing the
output from the compiler.  An extension of "ASM" is assumed.
Five passes are made through the code making a variety of
optimisations.  The optimised code is left in the original file,
i.e. the original contents of that file are overwritten.  At the
end of the optimisation the program reports the savings it
manages to make on the console.

The -c flag instructs the optimiser to generate 'compact' code.
This means that certain in-line expansion of run-time routines
is not performed, resulting in smaller, though slightly slower,
code.  By default all optimisations are performed.

 
EXAMPLE
 
To optimise the file FRED.ASM use a command of the form:
 
	A>zopt fred
		...
		optimisation statistics
		...
	A>
