NAME
	zlib - creates library file
 
SYNOPSIS
	zlib	libfile
 
DESCRIPTION 

ZLIB goes through all files with the extension "OBJ" on the
current disk and builds a library file and index file from them.
The index is used by the ZRES program to resolve references to
library routines.

The 'libfile' should not have an extension.  Two output files
are created, LIBFILE.LIB is the library and LIBFILE.IDX is the
index.
	
The index file has two parts.  In the first part each module in
the library is listed together with its offset in the library
file (sector number and offset within sector).  In the second
part the labels in each module are listed.  If a label is
referenced in a module it is followed by the negative of the
module number.  If a label is defined in a module it is followed
by the module number.

The library file contains all the .OBJ files as separate
modules.

 
EXAMPLE
 
To index all the "OBJ" files on drive C:, with the output being
sent to the files 'clib.lib' and 'clib.idx', use the command:
 
	C>zlib clib
	C>
