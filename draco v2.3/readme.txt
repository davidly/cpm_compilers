			About the Draco Disks

There are 3 disks in this set:

1 - documentation - writeups on the language, tools, programs, etc.
	Also contains lots of sample Draco sources.

2 - compiler - contains the compiler, linker, assembler, disassembler,
	librarian, cross-referencer, libraries and include files

3 - programs - contains programs which must be configured using the CONFIG
	program: several games and the editor


All material on these disks are supplied "as is" with no warrantees or
guarantees of any kind. The tools, especially the compiler and linker, have
been heavily used and should be fairly bug free. Some of the games have
known glitches.

All material on these disks is supplied as "copyrighted shareware". This
means that you can use the supplied material as you see fit, and you can
give away copies of the disks to anyone, so long as this file, named
"README.TXT" is included on each disk. The author retains all other rights
to the software.

This software was originally intended as commercial software, and some of
the writeups reflect this orientation. Due to the lack of a viable market
for CP/M-80, character based software, this software is now being
distributed as "shareware", in which user's are requested to send a suitable
donation to the author if they feel the software merits it. Such
contributions can be thought of as encouragement to the author to create
and release more software and more versions of the current software.
Currently under way is a conversion of the compiler to generate MC68000
code. The immediate target machine is the Commodore Amiga. Soon to follow
that is a comprehensive graphics adventure system originally written for
CP/M-80 using the Compupro "Spectrum" graphics board.
