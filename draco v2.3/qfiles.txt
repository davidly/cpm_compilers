     Over the last 3 days I've whipped up what might pass as an early 
version of a skeleton for the Quest system. It contains screen handling 
routines, a parser, attribute/object handling routines and a simple main 
program which uses the library routines to implement a small 'world'. 
There is currently no goal to the world other than moving around in it. 
It accepts the following commands:

    quit [PUNC]
    look [around] [PUNC]
    get [ART] N [PUNC]
    pick up [ART] N [PUNC]
    pick [ART] N up [PUNC]
    drop [ART] N [PUNC]
    put down [ART] N [PUNC]
    put [ART] N down [PUNC]
    DIR [PUNC]

where

    PUNC - '.', '!';
    ART - 'the', 'a', 'an', 'one'
    N - 'sword', 'knife', 'amulet', 'purse', 'bottle'
    DIR - 'north', 'south', 'east', 'west', 'n', 's', 'e', 'w'

Case isn't important, so example commands are:

    get bottle
    Put the sword down!
    N
    South.

     The screen format I've used corresponds to what we have discussed 
earlier: a horizontal line in the middle separates the lower, textual 
interaction area from the top areas. A vertical line in the middle of 
the top separates the bird's-eye-view map area from the status area. 
I've done routines for handling text I/O (with word break), map scenery 
generation with movable objects and automatic windowing, and status 
routines for numeric, string and string-list status objects.

     The code is all Draco code, because that's what was easiest on my 
system. The files transferred to MTS under id QG8W are:

    DOC - detailed description of what the routines do
    Q.G - include file describing the routines to the compiler
    QMAIN.DRC - source for the main program (scenario)
    QCRT.DRC - source for the CRT handling routines
    QPARSE.DRC - source for the parser
    QLIST.DRC - source for list/attribute/property handlers

Files DOC, Q.G and QMAIN.DRC are permitted read to the world. The other 
three will be permitted to those who want to translate them to 
MTS/Pascal. Note that I have no intention of doing any of the 
translation or conversion, but I will offer advice and explanations to 
those who do it.
