                                                Release date: May, 1980
Pascal/M User:

This release of PASCAL/M(tm) has the following changes:

1.  Config.pco is a pascal program to configure PRUN.com this should
    be used instead of the CONSTRL.asm file. If your terminal is not
    supported, then use the framework of CONSTRL.asm to patch
    PRUN.com for your terminal.

1a. NOTE: use this only if neccessary!!
    New CONSTRL interface that supports a user defined date and
    time.  Also the space reserved for CONSTRL has been enlarged
    to be 256 bytes long.  This new constrl allows the user to define
    additional CONACT functions and also allows for varying the delay
    for each console action.
            NOTE:
                 YOU MUST USE THE NEW VERSION
                 OF CONSTRL WITH THIS RELEASE.
1b. There is a new version of CONTEST.pas to help verify the workings
    of the CONFIG.pco( or CONSTRL.asm deck). It is self explanitory
    when compiled and run with the new PASCAL/M.
2.  The return address for assembly procs has been changed from
    200h to 2C0h.
3.  Pascal no longer gives a sign-on message.
4.  READLN has been reworked to improve execution speed.
5.  A fix has been made to correct end-case errors in random
    i/o.
6.  The compiler no longer issues a conact(0) at new page when
    the listing device is console.
7.  RESET and REWRITE now work according to the ISO Standard (DRAFT).
    ie. if no second argument is supplied a file name of FILVAR.$$$
    is used.  A RESET(FILVAR) will rewind a currently opened file as
    per our manual, if the file is not opened a open read operation
    of FILVAR.$$$ is issued.
    IORESULT is no longer supported for file open checking. EOF is set
    to true if the file does not exist or is empty. Otherwise, EOF is
    set to false.
8.  Support for up to 40 user segments is included in this version.
    This is a four fold increase from previous releases.  This
    enhancements should allows for larger programs and be compatible
    with hard disk applications needing more code space.
9.  NL parameter on command line.
    A new control card argument has been added at user requests
    to force a CR,LF after each PROCEDURE status line is sent to
    the console.  This feature is active if the user sets 'nl'
    on the command line.
10. New proc RENAME(FILVAR, 'newname');
    This procedure allows a user to rename a CLOSED file defined
    in by FILVAR to that named in the 2nd argument (string).  If
    the FILVAR is NOT closed a runtime error will occur.  If the
    newname already exist on the specified disk an error indicating
    duplicate file will happen.
11. Change to SCAN:
    The SCAN function has be DROPPED.
    It is replaced with two new functions:
              SCANEQ(length, char, array):integer;
    and       SCANNE(length, char, array):integer;
    users currently using the SCAN function should note this change
    and start using the new form support by the enclosed version of
    the compiler.
    THE REASON FOR THIS CHANGE IS TO CONFORM TO THE ISO STANDARD AND
    TO PROMOTE TRANSPORTABLE PASCAL PROGRAMS......
12. Real arithmatic now has 14 digits of precision,  the trignometric
    functions have been upgraded to support this precision.
13. A symbolic debugger (PASDDT) to support interactive debugging is
    provided.  Refer to Ch.19 of the manual.
13a. Also PASDDT now does:
     1.) The MAP option is now tied to the D option. When the D option
         is turned off for a particular procedure, no symbols will be 
         generated for that procedure.
     2.) When a program has too many symbols for PASDDT, the debugger
         will print the list of symbols successfully read in. The user
         can then selectively turn off D for those procedures that are
         not being debugged. After recompilation, the user should then
         be able to get the crucial symbols needed.
14. A problem with READ/LN into a packed array of char has been fixed.
15. A new version of DATTIM.com has been provided to set the date and
    time used in PASCAL as well as printer listings. DATTIM is self-
    prompting, but if you type DATTIM ?<cr> a help message will be 
    printed.
16. AMD 9511 is no longer supported as well.

17. CPM 1.4 IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED !!

NOTE:  ALL old PCO files cannot be used with this release without
       re-compiling.
