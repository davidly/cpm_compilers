	STDLIB2.C -- for BDS C v1.41 -- 10/14/80

	This file contains the source for the following
	library functions:

	printf 		fprintf		sprintf		_spr
	scanf		fscanf		sscanf		_scn
	fgets
	puts		fputs
	swapin

	Note that all the upper-level formatted I/O functions
	("printf", "fprintf", "scanf", and "fscanf") now use
	"_spr" and "_scn" for doing conversions. While
	this leads to very modularized source code, it also
	means that calls to "scanf" and "fscanf" must process
	ALL the information on a line of text; if the format
	string runs out and there is still text left in the
	line being processed, the text will be lost (i.e., the
	NEXT scanf or fscanf call will NOT find it.)

	An alternate version of "_spr" is given in the file
	FLOAT.C for use with floating point numbers; see FLOAT.C
	for details. Since "_spr" is used by "printf", this
	really amounts to an alternate version of "printf."

	Also note that temporary work space is declared within
	each of the high-level functions as a one-dimensional
	character array. The length limit on this array is
	presently set to 132 by the #define MAXLINE statement;
	if you intend to create longer lines through printf,
	fprintf, scanf, or fscanf calls, be SURE to raise this
	limit by changing the #define statement.

	Some misc. comments on hacking text files with CP/M:
	The conventional CP/M text format calls for each
	line to be terminated by a CR-LF combination. In the
	world of C programming, though, we like to just use
	a single LF (also called a newline) to terminate
	lines. AND SO, the functions which deal with reading
	and writing text lines from disk files to memory and
	vice-versa ("fgets", "fputs") take special pains to
	convert	CR-LF combinations into single '\n' characters
	when reading from disk ("fgets"), and convert '\n'
	characters to CR-LF combinations when writing TO disk
	("fputs"). This allows the C programmer to do things
	in style, dealing only with a single line terminator
	while the text is in memory, while maintaining compat-
	ibility with the CP/M text format for disk files (so
	that, for example, a text file can be "type"d under
	the CCP.)
	To confuse matters further, the "gets" function
	(which simply buffers up a line of console input)
	terminates a line with '\0' (a zero byte) instead
	of CR or LF. Thus, if you want to read in lines of
	input from the console and write them to a file,
	you'll have to manually put out the CR and LF at the
	end of every line ("gets" was designed this was to
	be compatible with the UNIX version). 

	Remember to put out a 0x1a (control-Z, CPMEOF) at
	the end of text files being written out to disk.

	Also, watch out when reading in text files using
	"getc". While a text file is USUALLY terminated
	with a control-Z, it MAY NOT BE if the file ends
	on an even sector boundary (although respectable
	editors will now usually make sure the control-Z
	is always there.) This means that there are two
	possible return values from "getc" which can signal
	an End-of file: CPMEOF ( 0x1a, or control-Z),
	ERROR (-1, or 255 if you assign it to a char variable)
	should the CPMEOF (0x1a) be missing.

/*
	printf

	usage:
		printf(format, arg1, arg2, ...);
	
	Note that since the "_spr" function is used to
	form the output string, and then "puts" is used to
	actually print it out, care must be taken to 
	avoid generating null (zero) bytes in the output,
	since such a byte will terminate printing of the
	string by puts. Thus, a statment such as:

		printf("%c foo",'\0');

	would print nothing at all.

	This is my latest version of the "printf" standard library
	routine. This time, folks, it REALLY IS standard. I've
	tried to make it EXACTLY the same as the version presented
	in Kernighan & Ritchie: right-justification of fields is
	now the default instead of left-justification (you can have
	left-justification by using a dash in the conversion, as
	specified in the book); the "%s" conversion can take a precision
	now as well as a field width; the "e" and "f" conversions, for
	floating point numbers, are supported in a special version of
	"_spr" given in source form in the FLOAT.C file. If you do
	a lot of number crunching and wish to have that version be the
	default (it eats up a K or two more than this version), just
	replace the version of "_spr" in DEFF.CRL with the one in FLOAT.C,
	using the CLIB program, or else be stuck with always typing in
	"float" on the clink command line...

	Usage:
		scanf(format, ptr1, ptr2, ...);

	Returns number of items matched.

	Since a new line of text must be entered from the
