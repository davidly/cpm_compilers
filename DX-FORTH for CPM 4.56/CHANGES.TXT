                          IMPORTANT CHANGES

This document discusses changes to DX-Forth for CP/M that may adversely
affect previously written programs.  It is recommended users update their
programs to the latest DX-Forth version.  See WHATSNEW.TXT for a summary
of other changes and additions.

v4.56

   INTEGER has replaced VALUE in the distribution and is the preferred
   choice for future applications.  INTEGER works similarly to VALUE
   with the exception a parameter is not used at creation.

   CASE ENDOF ENDCASE VALUE are deprecated and moved to TOOLS.SCR.

v4.56

   DOSLIB: overhaul parsing
   NEWAPP: alternate run-time for PARSFN

v4.55

   Rename -ALLOT to RECOVER

   DOSLIB: overhaul strings, files, parsing

v4.54

   Floating-point output functions have been rationalized.  FE. FE.R G.
   G.R are deleted and the functionality of G. G.R is included in F. F.R
   respectively.  Programs requiring F. or F.R to maintain fixed-point
   notation can use (F.) or redefine:

     \ AKA G. F.
     \ AKA G.R F.R
     : F.R  >R (F.) R> S.R ;
     : F.  -1 (F.) TYPE SPACE ;
     \ : FE.R  >R (FE.) R> S.R ;
     \ : FE.  -1 (FE.) TYPE SPACE ;

   Control-flow stack operators (CS-ROLL et al) are disabled in the
   kernel.  They are provided in CFSEXT.SCR if required.

v4.53

   Simplified NUMBER? with the side-effect S" ." is no longer rejected.

   DOSLIB changes:

     Rename ?BADOPTION /HEXNUM /NUMRANGE to ?BADOPT /HEX /NUM[].

v4.50

   /PARSE and the method of entering delimiter characters within a
   string has been replaced with backslash '\xx' escapes.  See S" in
   the glossary for further details.  Old code that used backslash '\'
   within a quoted string will need to be replaced with '\\'.  Such
   instances, however, are likely to be few.

   Kernel C/STRING renamed to /CHAR

v4.45

   READ-LINE status changed from true|false result to a ternary value
   (-1|0|1).  See DXFORTH.GLO for details.

   ." is now state-smart allowing it to be used in interpret mode.
   .( is deprecated and moved to TOOLS for backward compatibility.
   Applications supplied in the DX-Forth distribution have been updated
   to reflect the change.

   MOVE is made smarter by copying nothing if source and destination
   addresses are the same.  CMOVE and CMOVE> always copy.

   DOSLIB changes:

     C/STRING moved to kernel.  (D.R) (U.R) is removed as applications
     can use new string function (S.R), or define:

     : (D.R) ( d w -- a u )  >R (D.) R> (S.R) ;
     : (U.R) ( u w -- a u )  0 SWAP (D.R) ;

v4.44

   #FCB is deleted and its function replaced by an entry in the SYS-VEC
   table.  See #FCB in the glossary.

   DOSLIB changes:

     Renamed /INBUF /OUTBUF to #INBUF #OUTBUF

v4.43

   .NAME is deleted.  The direct equivalent is: >NAME .ID

   Removed embedded string '(y/n)' from Y/N.

   /NUMBER introduced in 4.42 is replaced with a new function.  Previous
   usage should be replaced with:  0 0 2SWAP >NUMBER

   >FLOAT reverts back to Forth-94 specification in respect of string
   of blanks and empty string (see 4.42 below).

   Mapping of CP/M 3 codes for RETURN is changed from $FF7F..FF00 to
   $FF01..FF7F.

   DOSLIB changes:

     FINDALL now requires the attribute (usually 0) be provided as an
     argument.

     Renamed QSORT FREPOS REPOSINFILE REPOSOUTFILE INFILEPOS OUTFILEPOS
     to SORT FSEEK SEEKINFILE SEEKOUTFILE POSINFILE POSOUTFILE
     respectively.

     /INTEGER /RAWNUM are deleted.  Kernel /NUMBER replaces /INTEGER.
     /RAWNUM may be replaced by /NUMBER DROP.

     >FID returns -1 to indicate handle closed (previously 0).

v4.42

   ALLOT and RESERVE no longer perform an ERASE.  This permits data of
   arbitrary length to be loaded at HERE and then ALLOTed.  See /ALLOT
   /RESERVE in MISC.SCR for versions that erase.

   Forth-94 recommendation that >FLOAT returns 0.0E and true for a
   string of blanks is no longer supported.  A zero length string now
   returns false.  See >FLOAT in glossary.

   The fig-FORTH convention of making vocabularies IMMEDIATE has been
   adopted.  Consequently FORTH ASSEMBLER HIDDEN EDITOR are now
   immediate.

   RESET-DISKS has been removed due to portability issues.  Change disk
   functionality can be implemented using GETDSK RESETDISK SELDSK from
   DOSLIB.SCR.  Note that Function 13 (RESETDISK) behaves somewhat
   differently between CP/M and MS-DOS and care must be taken when
   using this function portably.

v4.41

   Character propagation in CMOVE & CMOVE> is no longer supported.  To
   fill a region with a specified character use FILL.

v4.40

   CSP changed from double cell variable back to a single.  Files in the
   distribution updated.

   TYPE changed to use unsigned count.  SPACES count remains signed for
   backward compatibility but see glossary on handling negative counts.

   SETFCB has changed in the case when no drive/user is specified.  The
   FCB will use the drive/user in effect at the time it is activated -
   not when initialized as previously.

   Changed FILE-FCB stack effect for compatibility with >FCB (.FCB) .

   FINDFIRST (DOSLIB) requires a dummy attribute (0) for compatibility
   with MS-DOS version.

   Renamed USER# [UP] to U# [U] respectively in the assembler.

v4.30

   Removed immediate EXIT and renamed (EXIT) to EXIT.

   Non-zero RETURN codes are now seen by CP/M 3 as "unsuccessful" (same
   as Z-System).  See glossary entry for RETURN.

v4.12

   EDIT can no longer be used to load the editor from disk.  You must use
   SED or TED for that.  Once the editor is loaded and saved as part of
   the system, EDIT can be added as a synonym.

v4.10

   ALLOT has been changed (for the better).  Unlike Forth-94 ALLOT only
   unsigned values may be used.  Applications which used negative values
   with ALLOT should be changed to use -ALLOT instead.  Programs which
   require Forth-94 behaviour can be accommodated with the following
   redefinition:

     : ALLOT ( n -- )  NEGATE -ALLOT ;

   Note however that memory checking is not performed.

v4.06

   Functions '.' and '?' adopt the eForth behaviour i.e. when BASE is
   decimal display signed; otherwise display unsigned.  Only these
   functions and those which use them are affected.  Applications
   requiring Forth-94 behaviour may redefine:

     : . ( n -- )  S>D D. ;
