Statements:    (can be used from either command or RUN mode)

* APPEND [DISK(<0-3>),]<string expression>[,<string expression>]
Appends a section of program from the ASCII LOAD device (logical
unit #2) to the end of the program presently in memory.  If the
optional line descriptor string is present, execution will begin there.
If optional DISK function is not used, last disk accessed is used.
Examples:  APPEND DISK(3),"FOURIER"    APPEND SUBNAM$

* ASSIGN <logical device number>,<physical device number>
Assigns a physical device to a logical device.  Internally,
this command sets a bit in the MODES table.  See Appendix E
for a list of the logical and physical devices.
Examples:  ASSIGN 3,1   ASSIGN PR,CRT   ASSIGN LOGICAL,PHYSICAL

* BGET [FILE(<0-63>),][RECORD(<numeric expression>),]<variable list>
Reads from Binary Input logical device into named variables.
If optional file number is not used, the file accessed will
be the one used in the last executed FILE function.  An OPEN
statement with a matching file number must have been used already.
If the FILE function has not been used, file 0 is assumed.
Examples:   BGET RECORD(N),A$   BGET FILE(63),QTY,COST   BGET X,Y(N)

* BLOAD [DISK(<0-3>),]<string expression>[,<string expression>]
Reads a program named <string expression> into memory from the
binary input logical device.  All characters of string are used.
The program must have been saved with BSAVE statement.
If optional DISK function not used, last disk accessed is used.
If optional line descriptor string used, starts execution at
that location, and can be used to chain programs in this way.
Examples:   BLOAD "PAYROLL"   BLOAD NEXTPROG$,"BEGIN"

* BPUT [FILE(<0-63>),][RECORD(<num. expr.>),]<variable list>
Writes the named variables onto the binary output logical device.
The same rules about the FILE function apply as with BGET.
Examples:   BPUT FILE(N),RECORD(X),QTY   BPUT A,B,C(N)   BPUT X

* BSAVE [DISK(<0-3>),]<string expression>
Writes a program named <string expression> onto the binary output
logical device.  All characters of the string are used.  Programs
saved using this command will save and load considerably faster
than those saved with the SAVE command.
Examples:   BSAVE DISK(0),"PAYROLL"   BSAVE PROGNAME$

CHANNEL
Prints a table of the assignments of physical to logical
devices.  See Appendix E for the default assignments.

* CHECK
Makes the following mass storage input a checking operation,
instead of an actual read into memory.  It can be used before
a LOAD, BLOAD, GET, or BGET to check the data integrity.  An
error message will be issued if an error is detected.
Examples:  CHECK:LOAD "INV"     CHECK:BGET FILE(2),DATA$
