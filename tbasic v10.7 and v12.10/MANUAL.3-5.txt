* PROCEDURE <variable list>
Used to declare local variables.  The variables on the list can
be used without disturbing their original values in the main
program.  The original value of each variable will be restored by
the next RETURN statement.  (See GOPROC, RECEIVE, RETURN)
Examples:  PROCEDURE ANS$,X     PROCEDURE A,B,RESULT

* PUT [FILE(<0-63>),][RECORD(<num. expr.>),]<variable list>
Write from variables on <variable list> to the ASCII SAVE device.
The FILE used should have been previously OPEN'd.  If items on
the variable list are seperated by commas, a cr-lf pair is put
between each item on the disk file.  If semicolons are used,
no seperator is put between records.  The last item on the list
will end with a cr-lf unless followed by a semicolon.
Examples:   PUT FILE(7),PART$,COST   PUT X,Y   PUT RECORD(N),T$;

READ <variable list>
Assigns the value of each expression of a "DATA" statement to
a variable on the variable list, starting with the first element
of the first "DATA" statement.  Expressions of the "DATA"
statement(s) are evaluated when the first element of the "DATA"
statement is read.  (See DATA and RESTORE statements.)
Examples:     READ X,Y     READ X,Y,Z$     READ TABLE(N)

* RECEIVE <variable list>
Transfers values of variables from "GOPROC" or "RETURN" statement
to <variable list>.  The variables on the list are filled in
the same order that the variables appear on the GOPROC or RETURN
statement.  Examples:  RECEIVE X    RECEIVE RES$,ANSWER

REM[anything]
Allows insertion of remarks in the program text.  The remarks
must follow the REM statement on the same line.
Examples:  REM   THIS PROGRAM CALCULATES TRIG TABLES

RESET
Perform a disk operating system reset.  This may be used in
CP/M, for example, to reread the directory after changing a
disk, and before writing onto a new one.
Example:   RESET

RESTORE [<line identifier>]
Sets the READ DATA pointer to the first data statement, or,
optionally, to the statement <line identifier>.  This allows
reading seperate tables or seperate portions of a table without
having to read through all DATA statements.
Examples:  RESTORE      RESTORE TABLE2       RESTORE START+5

RETURN [<variable list>]
Causes execution to continue at the statement following the last
GOSUB or GOPROC statement executed.  If the optional variable list is
included, passes the values of the variables on the list to
the variables on the list of a "RECEIVE" statement.
Examples:  RETURN    RETURN N    RETURN X$,ANSWER,RESULT$

* SAVE [DISK(<0-3>),]<string expression>
Writes the BASIC program from memory onto the ASCII save device.
Examples:   SAVE DISK(2),"STARTREK"   SAVE PROGNAME$
