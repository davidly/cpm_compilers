		ERROR CODE EXPLANATIONS

The system of programming error detection and reporting
in TARBELL BASIC is a compromise between the need for
clear error reporting, and the memory required for error
detection and messages.  Some systems use error code numbers,
or 1 or 2 code letters.  These usually have to be looked up
in the reference manual, so they waste time.  Some use long
english explanations, which are nice, but take up a lot of
memory space.  TARBELL BASIC uses abbreviated messages, which
are hopefully easy to remember after they're looked up the first
time.
