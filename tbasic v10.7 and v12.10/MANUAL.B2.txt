<string constant>
A string constant is a sequence of any characters, represented
literally, either <alphanumeric character>s or <special character>s
enclosed in quotes ("), or CHR$ functions with a constant argument.
There is no limit to the length of a string constant.  Quotes may
be represented by a double quote (""), or by CHR$(34).  Control
characters may be represented by using the CHR$ function.
Examples:  "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 0123456789 !"    "#$%&'()"

<constant>
A value which is named as such explicity in the program.  May be 
either a <string constant> or a <numeric constant>.
Examples:    "DON TARBELL"    3.14159    2    "ABCDEFG"

<expression>
A sequence of constants and/or variables, separated by operators
according to certain rules (see pages 14&15) and optionally grouped
by parenthesis.
Examples:  1    X    "ABC"+REST$    3*(X/Y)    SQR(B^2-4*A*C)

<numeric expression>
An expression which evaluates to a number.
Examples:  1+1   2*(3+5)   N/2   4*LEN(STRING$)   SIN(X)

<string expression>
An expression which evaluates to a string.
Examples:  LEFT$("ABCDEFG",3)   "123"+"ABC"+A$   CHR$(N+64)

<expression list>
A sequence of expressions normally separated by commas or semicolons.
Examples:  "THE COST IS ";COST;" DOLLARS.",TOTAL,X*5/Y    X,Y    X

<variable>
An entity which can assume different values, either string or numeric.

<variable name>
A sequence of <alphanumeric character>s, beginning with a letter,
which is used to identify a particular variable.  If a variable
name ends with a dollar sign ($), it is forced to a string.
