		INTERNAL FORMATS

Symbol Table Format:  ASCII, last character has bit 7 set=1.

Symbol Directory Format:
Bytes 0&1 are pointer to location (0 if inactive dummy).
Byte 2 bits have meanings as follows:
  0-statement name	1-variable	2-function
  3-channel name	4-array		5-unused
  6-has been stored to	7-trace on

Numeric Array Format:
bytes n,n+1 = back pointer
bytes 2+n to n+x+1 = number of elements per dimension
where n=(table pointer), and x=number of dimensions
bytes 2+n+x to 1+n+x+(6*E) = number storage
where E=total number of elements
To locate an element within an array, location=base+offset,
where base=2+n+x, and offset computed by:
	N=1
	OFFSET=S(N)
LOOP	N=N+1
	OFFSET=(OFFSET)(D(N))+S(N)
	IF N<>LAST DIMENSION GOTO LOOP
	OFFSET=OFFSET*6
	END
Where S is subscript, D cements in a dimension, () mean contents of.
Example:  Array dimensioned 3,4,5; Get element 2,1,4.
	N	Offset
	1	2
	2	2*4+1=9
	3	9*5+4=49
	3	49*6=294

String Locator:
  bytes n,n+1=back pointer.
  bytes n+2 to n+1+m=number of elements per dimension.
  bytes m+n+2 to n+1+(2E)+m=string pointers.
  Where m=number of dimensions, and E=number of elements.
  2 Bytes per pointer, same organization as elements of
  numeric arrays.  If (pointer)=0, string is (null).
  Otherwise, points to first address of (string).

String Format:
  bytes n,n+1=back pointer.
  n+2 to n+1+m=ASCII data.
  Where m=number of characters.  Last character as bit 7=1.
  All other characters have bit 7=0.
