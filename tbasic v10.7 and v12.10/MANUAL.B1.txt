<numeric constant>
A number, represented by a series of numerals, preceeded by
an optional plus (+) or minus (-) sign, including an optional decimal
point (.), and ending with an optional "E", followed by a +, =, or
a space, followed by a power of ten.  Three characters must follow
the "E".  A space may be used instead of a plus sign (+).
The range of a floating point number (one with a decimal point) is
from 9.9999999E+99 to 9.9999999E-99, plus and minus.  The range of
a integer number is from 0 to 9999999999, plus and minus.  Expressions
evaluate to integers if and only if every element of the expression
evaluates to an integer.
