			OPERATORS

Arithmetic Operators (in order of precedence)

1.  expressions enclosed in parenthesis
2.  ^		exponentiation
3.  -		negation
4.  *  /	multiplication and division
5.  +  -	addition and subtraction
6.  relational operators (same for all)
	=	equal
	<>	not equal
	<	less than
	>	greater than
	<=	less than or equal
	>=	greater than or equal
7.  NOT		inversion of all bits
8.  AND		logical multiplication of each bit
9.  OR		logical addition of each bit






String Operators

1.  +		Concatenates (hooks together) two strings end-to-end.

2.  Comparison Operators

	=	equals
	>	greater than
	<	less than
	<=	less than or equal
	>=	greater than or equal
	<>	not equal

    Comparison is made by comparing the ASCII codes of each character
    of each string, starting with the first character of each string.
    The comparison continues with each set of corresponding characters
    until there is a mismatch, at which time the string with the code
    having the higher ASCII value is declared the greater.  If there
    is no mismatch, the strings are of equal value.  If one string is
    shorter than the other, the longer string is considered greater.
