Commands:  (can only be used from command mode)

* BYE
Causes a jump to location 0000 in memory.  Example:  BYE

CHANGE <line descriptor> [<line descriptor>]
Performs the DELETE command, then the ENTER command at the
first line descriptor.  Example:   CHANGE LOOP LOOP+5

CLEAR [<expression>]
Sets all program variables to zero.  Sets all strings to nulls.
Releases all string and array space.  In ALTAIR BASIC,
"CLEAR <<expression>>" defines the amount of space to allot
for strings.  TARBELL BASIC will automatically allot all space not
being used for actual programs to strings and arrays.  To maintain
compatability with ALTAIR BASIC, "CLEAR <expression>" will be
processed identically to the CLEAR command.
Examples:  CLEAR		CLEAR 2000  (does the same thing)

CONT
Continues program execution after a control/C has been input or
after a "STOP" or "END" statement has been executed.  Execution
resumes at the statement following the break, unless an input
from the terminal was interrupted.  In the latter case, execution
resumes with the interrupted statement.  Execution cannot be
continued if the program was modified by direct
mode entries.  Example:    CONT

* DELETE <line descriptor> [<line descriptor>]
Eliminates the line(s) indicated from the stored program.  If only
the first <line descriptor> is present, only that one line is deleted.
If both <line descriptor>'s are present, both those lines, and
all lines in between are deleted.  If there is no such line
descriptor, an error message is issued.
Examples:	DELETE START+4	    DELETE LOOP LOOP+5

* ENTER [<line descriptor>]  or  :[<line descriptor>]
Causes TARBELL BASIC to go to program entry mode.  Any input after
this statement is interpreted as program statements.  A carriage
return delimits each line.  The "ENTER" statement is provided to
allow statements without names to be entered.  If <line descriptor>
is ommitted, entry begins after the last statement currently in
memory.  If <line descriptor> is present, entry begins immediately before
the line indicated.  Entry mode is terminated by two carriage returns 
in a row.  Multiple statements per line are allowed if separated by a colon.
The colon shown in the command format above, however, is a shorthand
form of ENTER, the same way that "?" is a shorthand form of PRINT.
The first line in a program should always have a label.
If any of the following commands are invoked from entry mode, they
will be performed, then command mode will be reentered:
  LIST,DELETE,EDIT,RUN.
Examples:	ENTER	    ENTER ADDC+3     ENTER LOOP     : START+1

LIST [<line descriptor>] [<line descriptor>]
Lists the program starting from the statement corresponding with
the first <line descriptor>, until the end is reached, if there is no
second <line descriptor>, or until a control/C is entered.
If neither <line descriptor> is present, the whole program is listed.
Examples:	LIST     LIST START+10     LIST LOOP END1
