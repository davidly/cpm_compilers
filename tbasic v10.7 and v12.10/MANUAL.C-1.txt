			MEMORY USAGE - version 9.7

Address Range	Description
(hexadecimal)

0000 to 00FF	Unused, available space for your stuff, except in
		CP/M systems, where it is used by CP/M.

0100 to 07FF	Standard Input/Output Routines (Listing Included).
		There may be extra room here.  See the listing.

0800 to 0802	A jump instruction into TARBELL BASIC.

0803 to 0870	A table of addresses, each of which point to a
		useful table, subroutine, or parameter in BASIC.
		These addresses may be used from outside the
		main body of the interpreter.  Examples of this
		are shown in the Tarbell BASIC I/O system listing.
		See page C-2 for a list of these addresses.

0871 to 5A5B	The TARBELL BASIC interpreter, which may be in ROM.
		Note that these addresses may change with versions.

5A5C to 5C3A	Interpreter Workspace, must be in RAM. (fixed length)
		This can be seen on the last page of the source
		listing as a series of DS's.

Pointer Names

FSRC		Program Source, in internal form.  Fixed at RUN time.

ESRC		Variables and Array Pointers.  Fixed at RUN time.

FRAV to PNTR	FOR/NEXT and local variable (control) stack.  Dynamic.

PNTR+100	Input Line Space.  Dynamic.


NOTE:  The preceeding areas expand upward in memory addressing,
       the following areas expand downward in memory addressing.


FARY		Array and String Space.  Dynamic.

SDIR		Symbol Directory.  Fixed at RUN time.

STAB		Symbol Table.  Fixed at RUN time.

MEND		End of Specified Memory.



Allocation Notes:
Before runtime, will consist only of moving the symbol directory
as the symbol table grows.  At runtime, variable and array pointers
fished out of symbol directory and space assigned.  As local variables
are encountered, they are assigned on the stack.  Arrays and strings
are assigned by sequential assignment-random release- clean up garbage
when full.
