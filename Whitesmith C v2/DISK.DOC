BACK UP THE DELIVERY MEDIA!

Before using any of the CP/M submit scripts, read the script and
transfer any files mentioned, along with the script itself, to
drive A.

A minimal C system disk should probably contain:
(your text editor), submit.com
pp.com, p1.com, p2.com, an.com, ld80.com, c.sub, ld.sub
std.h, clib.a, mlib.a, chdr.r

See the C Users Manual and the 8080 Interface Manual for use of the
above commands.  The C language itself, and the contents of the C
library, are specified in the C Users Manual.  A good tutorial on C,
as well as the most complete reference, can be found in "The C
Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie (Prentice Hall)
(also available from Morrow Designs).
