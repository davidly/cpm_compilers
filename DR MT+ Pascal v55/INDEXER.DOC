Indexer inputs a Pascal source file and outputs one of two forms
of index file.  The first is the short form: only the procedure 
or function declarations are extracted from the source.  The 
second is the long form: everything between the keyword 'procedure'
or 'function' and the keyword 'begin' is extracted.
Invoke indexer with the following command line:

INDEXER <SOURCE FILE> <DESTINATION FILE> [SHORT | LONG]
