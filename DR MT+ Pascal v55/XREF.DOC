The files XREF.SRC and XREF.COM are the source and object
of a Pascal cross referencing program.  They are public
domain and not specific to Pascal/MT+ (i.e. may be used
to cross reference other Pascal programs).  They may 
also be used to cross reference other languages if the
keyword table is changed.

To operate:

1. Type XREF<cr>

2. XREF asks: Input file? <you type: full file name (e.g. A.SRC)>

3. XREF asks: Output file name? <you type: full file or device name:>
				           <filename> or
					   CON: or
					   LST:

4. XREF asks: Do you want a listing? (N means No, anything else means YES)

And that's it!
