\ BREAK GO                                                      Breakpoint tool (adapted from Forth Dimensions 5/1)                                                                             BREAK is inserted into the application source code at the point to be debugged.  When BREAK is subsequently executed, the       application is temporarily halted and the current stack contentsdisplayed.  The user will then be in a special interpret loop   (indicated by the '<ok>' prompt) during which time the system   may be examined.  The application can be resumed at any time    using GO.                                                                                                                       Executing QUIT or ABORT while halted (e.g. as a result of       mistyping a command) will result in the user dropping back to   forth.                                                                                                                                                                                          \ BREAK GO                                                      forth definitions system                                        variable bsd   create buf 80 allot                                                                                              : bip ( -- )                                                      begin cr ." <ok> " buf dup 80 accept space evaluate again ;                                                                   \ Halt application                                              : BREAK ( i*x -- i*x )  cr ."
