	    New Features For BDS C v1.44	April 29, 1981
	    ----------------------------	--------------

1. CC1, CC2  and CLINK may now be interrupted during execution by typing
   control-C.

2. CLINK: prefixing a CRL filename by "-f " forces all functions in that file
   to be loaded, whether they have been previously referenced or not. If any
   functions in that file have already been loaded, though, then a message to
   that effect is printed and the redundant version is not reloaded. For ex-
   ample,
		A>clink test -f xlib more <cr>

   causes ALL functions from XLIB.CRL, whether referenced or not,  to be
   linked into TEST.COM. After that, MORE.CRL (and DEFF.CRL and DEFF2.CRL)
   are scanned for needed functions, but only the ones explicitly referenced
   are picked off.
