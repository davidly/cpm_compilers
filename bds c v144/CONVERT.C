		"CONVERT"
		WRITTEN BY LEOR ZOLMAN

	THIS PROGRAM CONVERTS REGULAR C SOURCE FILES INTO A 
	FORMAT SUITABLE FOR EDITING ON THE TRS-80 (OR ANY
	UPPER-CASE-ONLY SYSTEM.) SINCE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW
	ASCII CHARACTERS THAT NEED TO BE REPRESENTED EVEN
	THOUGH THEY DON'T SHOW UP ON UPPER-CASE-ONLY SYSTEMS,
	A SPECIAL NOTATION HAS BEEN CREATED FOR REPRESENTING
	THESE CHARACTERS. THE POUND SIGN IS USED AS A
	SORT OF 'SHIFT' KEY, WITH THE LETTER FOLLOWING THE
	POUND SIGN DENOTING THE SPECIAL CHARACTER NEEDED.
	NOTE THAT THE C COMPILER DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THIS
	SPECIAL SCHEME, AND BEFORE YOU CAN COMPILE A SOURCE
	FILE CONTAINING THE SPECIAL CODES YOU MUST PREPROCESS
	THE FILE USING THE "CC0T" COMMAND.

	THE SPECIAL CODES AND THE CHARACTERS THEY REPRESENT ARE:
	#L	LEFT BRACKET (FOR SUBSCRIPTING) (5B HEX)
	#R	RIGHT BRACKET			(5D HEX)
	#C	CIRCUMFLEX (BITWISE "NOT")	(7E HEX)
	#H	UP-ARROW (EXCLUSIVE "OR" OPERATOR)
						(5E HEX)
	#V	VERTICAL VAR (LOGICAL AND BITWISE "OR")
						(7C HEX)
	#B	BACKSLASH (FOR ESCAPE SEQUENCES)(5C HEX)
	#U	UNDERSCORE			(5F HEX)

	FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMMAND
		A>CONVERT FOO.C BAR.CT

	WILL EXPECT FOO.C TO BE A NORMAL C SOURCE FILE ON
	DISK, AND WILL CONVERT IT INTO A FILE NAMED BAR.CT.
	THE FILE BAR.CT MAY THEN BE EDITED TO YOUR TASTE,
	BUT REMEMBER TO PREPROCESS IT WITH "CC0T" BEFORE
	APPLYING THE C COMPILER.

	AS YOU MAY HAVE GATHERED FROM ALL THIS, THE LANGUAGE
	"C" WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE IMPLEMENTED ON A SYSTEM
	HAVING UPPER-CASE ONLY; NEVERTHELESS, HERE IS A WAY
	FOR IT TO BE DONE.

	THIS PROGRAM IS RATHER SIMPLE, AND THUS IT WILL NOT
	RECOGNIZE THAT SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN QUOTES ARE NOT
	SUPPOSED TO BE CONVERTED.
